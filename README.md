# Analyzing-American-Baby-Name-Trends
## Overview
This project aims to analyze the trends and changes in American baby name tastes since 1920 using data provided by the United States Social Security Administration. We will examine which names have remained popular for over 100 years and how those names compare to more recent top baby names. Understanding trends and popularity is important for many businesses, so the skills we'll practice while answering these queries are broadly applicable.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:

To analyze the trends and changes in American baby name tastes since 1920.
To identify which names have remained popular for over 100 years.
To compare the popularity of names that have remained popular for over 100 years to more recent top baby names.
## Tools and Technologies
The following tools and technologies will be used to perform the analysis:

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas library
- Matplotlib library
## Results
The analysis of the American baby name trends produced the following results:

Names that have remained popular for over 100 years include Mary, John, William, Elizabeth, James, and Margaret.
Recent top baby names like Emma, Olivia, and Liam have become increasingly popular in the last few years but have not yet reached the level of popularity of names that have been popular for over 100 years.
The popularity of certain names has been influenced by cultural trends, such as the popularity of the name Karen in the 1960s and 1970s and its decline in recent years due to a cultural shift in the meaning of the name.
## Conclusion
The analysis of American baby name trends provides insights into the cultural and societal shifts that have occurred over the past 100 years. By understanding which names have remained popular and how they compare to more recent top baby names, we can gain a better understanding of the current cultural and societal trends. This knowledge can be valuable for businesses that rely on understanding the preferences and trends of their customers.
